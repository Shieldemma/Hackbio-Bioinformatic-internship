### Introduction
Globally, breast cancer is the leading invasive cancer among women. It accounts for nearly one-
quarter of invasive cancers in women worldwide, and one-sixth of all female cancers.[1]
This research focuses on identifying the multi-omic features associated with breast cancer
therapy   response,   emphasizing   on   the   need   to   build   machine   learning   models   to   predict
pathology end points of cytotoxic therapy. [2]
The objective  of the research is to develop and validate a machine learning model that can
accurately   predict   the   pathological   complete   response   (PCR)   following   neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, a critical outcome for breast cancer patients.

### Methodology
The study assembled a large and diverse cohort of breast cancer patients, ensuring a
representative sample for model development and validation.
Multi-omic   data   collection   was   employed  to   capture   comprehensive   genomic   and
transcriptomic   information   from   tumor   samples.   Additionally,   digital   pathology
techniques were used to analyze tumor morphology and cellular composition.
The researchers also extracted tumor mutational burden, immune cell infiltration, and
gene expression signatures associated with tumor biology and treatment response, from
the multi-omic data.
A gradient boosting algorithm was selected for model development, known for its ability
to handle complex relationships and non-linear interactions within the data.
